# Newton-Euler Dynamics

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the Newton-Euler algorithm and supporting functions for dynamic modeling of robotic systems. It includes examples for a simple planar RR (Revolute-Revolute) robot and a more complex 6-DOF industrial robot (Staubli TX90L), demonstrating the application of these algorithms in robot dynamics analysis.
