# Newton-Euler Dynamics

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the Newton-Euler algorithm and supporting functions for dynamic modeling of robotic systems. It includes examples for a simple planar RR (Revolute-Revolute) robot and a more complex 6-DOF industrial robot (Staubli TX90L), demonstrating the application of these algorithms in robot dynamics analysis. The math used for the inverse kinematics code of the staubliTX90 Robot was from the "Improved Inverse Kinematics Algorithm Using Screw Theory for a Six-DOF Robot Manipulator" paper: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.5772/60834
